## Overview

The idea for Financial Friendship came from a spreadsheet I actually keep for my own family's finances.  It occurred to me that the more often I updated that spreadsheet, the more in-tune I felt with our finances.  This application is essentially modeled after that spreadsheet!  When a user first accesses the application, they are greeted by the splash page with links to Login or Signup.
